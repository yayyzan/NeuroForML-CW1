    "## Task 1: implement a simulator for the model in the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Your simulator should have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with alpha synapse acting on the current (note: not on the membrane potential). You should have two time constants, membrane time constant and alpha synapse time constant.\n",
    "2. Background noise as a Poisson process (see notes below).\n",
    "3. Refractoriness (see notes below).\n",
    "4. Initialisation with an input spike burst as described in the paper.\n",
    "5. All-to-all connectivity between layers. That is, each neuron in layer $i$ is connected to each neuron in layer $j$ (with the same weight).\n",
    "6. Delay between layers (so a spike in layer $i$ takes a fixed amount of time before arriving in layer $i+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build your simulator iteratively adding features as you verify the properties and reproduce the plots below. For task 2A, you only need feature (1). For task 2B you need features (1-3). For task 3 onwards you need all 6 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: try to solve task 2A first using only a simulator with feature (1). Now add features (2-3) and solve task 2B. Once you've finished that, go back and check your code still works for taks 2A. Continue like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson background noise\n",
    "\n",
    "You can implement Poisson background noise by computing the mean number of expected noise spikes in any time step (product of sum of input firing rates and time step size), and then at each time step drawing a random, Poisson distributed value with this mean. You can the ``poisson`` function imported above to do this. Note that in this case there are two populations of neurons, one excitatory and one inhibitory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refractoriness\n",
    "\n",
    "After a spike, the neuron shuts down (membrane potential stays at reset value and incoming spikes are ignored) for a period of time called the refractory period. You can implement this by tracking, for each neuron, the last time it spiked, and only adding spikes for neurons which haven't fired within the refractory period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that simulates a single layer of the network, taking the output spikes of the previous layer as an input argument, and returning its own output spikes.\n",
    "* A function that generates spikes for an input burst in the same format as the input/output of the simulate layer function above."
